Snippets are fragments of code, usually related to keywords . 
For example the C language defines "for" and "do" as keywords, 
among others.  Since "for" is usually written
    as : 
         for (...;...;...) {
                 //code here
         }
Most users will create an abbreviation for the keyword "for" to add the
parenthesis and curly-braces such as : 
         iabb xFor for<space>(<space>;<space>;<space>)<space>{<cr><cr>}

To accomplish this using snippets, create a file with these lines :

 for ( <#cursor#>; ; ) {

 }

Now when editing a 'c' file, when you type 'for<C-S>' ,for is replaced by the
snippet of code you placed in the file.  Additionally the cursor is placed 
between the opening ( and the first ; ... ready for you to begin typing.
